# Product Life Cycle Managment campaign

The purpose of this repository is to show my front-end design chops. The landing page was built on proprietary marketing platform and used proprietary software for table data sections. Data sections have been disconnected from the server and are displayed as html for design-view purpose. All client-specific information and links have been removed from the code.

## Project Description
A life cycle management campaign for a B2B electrical industry sector that provided the tools and materials to track product conversions and performances for sales management. The page would be updated with real-time data from a database enabling the Champions to closely monitor performance. 

## How it Works
The landing page was built on proprietary marketing platform and used proprietary software for table data sections. Data sections have been disconnected from the server and are displayed as html for design-view purpose. 

**My landing page design for this campaign was created for one of my employers' clients, and shown in my design portfolio.
